# Registration-Prerequisite-

This program will input the university course list with their prerequisites ONCE at the start of program by reading this information from a file. Then, whenever a student is willing to register a number of courses, he/she will enter the courses they studied and the ones they want to register in. The system will allow or disallow the student from registering the course based on stored course prerequisites.
